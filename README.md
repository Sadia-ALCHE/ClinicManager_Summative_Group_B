Clinic Appointment & Patient Management System (Group B)

Project Overview
The Clinic Appointment & Patient Management System is a console-based Python application designed to help a small clinic manage:
Patient records
Doctor information
Appointment booking, cancellation, and rescheduling
The system uses CSV files for data storage and follows an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, making it suitable for beginner-level learners while meeting core programming requirements.
